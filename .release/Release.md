_Changes for v 2.2.2_:
- Added ability to 'ask developer' via E-mail for help, or send wish, advice or bug report;
- Added butterfly histogram with only vertical symmetry and 'snail' histogram (butterfly with no symmetry);
- Max FFT scale multiplier (internal volume value) is now 200;
- Butterfly/perspective: peaks transparency are now depends on their values; it makes higher peaks more remarkable;
- Replaced old drawing algorithm for butterfly and perspective histograms; it doesn't contain all known graphic artifacts
