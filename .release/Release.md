_Changes for v 2.1_:
- Butterfly/perspective: peaks transparency are now depends on their values; it makes higher peaks more remarkable;
- Butterfly/perspective: removed logo drawing artifact (too large cicrle with background color in its center; now it allows logo to leave traces);
- Replaced old drawing algorithm for butterfly and perspective histograms; it doesn't contain all known graphic artifacts;
- Adjusted skipping frequencies area around 0 Hz;
- Some new modes await applying
