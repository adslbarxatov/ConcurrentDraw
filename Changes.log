ConcurrentDraw changes log

Version 1.2 (first publication):
• Supports getting FFT data from specified audio output using BASS library;
• Supports getting list of supported devices;
• Supports drawing static and moving spectrograms based on FFT data;
• Supports adjustable beats detection (frequencies range and amplitude threshold);
• Supports 4 palettes for spectrograms;
• Supports holding of settings for spectrogram palettes, window size and
  position, specified output device, beats detection metrics

Version 1.3:
• Generic code improvements;
• Added support for 'always on top' flag;
• Added support for adjustable FFT scale multiplier (spectrogram contrast);
• Added histogram mode up to 22050 Hz;
• Added high contrast palette 'Sunshine'

Version 1.4:
• Added 'Acid' palette with high contrast on high amplitudes;
• Added 'Butterfly' histogram mode;
• Generic code improvements;
• Fixed incorrect behavior of main window when it's always on top and user
  calls settings interface;
• Fixed logo redraw and placement in different modes

Version 1.4.1:
• Added versions checker: now application will launch only with compatible
  libraries

Version 1.5:
• Settings interface improvements applied;
• Added support for adjustable quantity of FFT values for histograms building;
• Beats detector's behavior updated;
• Fixed behavior of 'Cancel' button at first start of application;
• Code improvements applied;
• Added user manual at first launch and on '?' button

Version 1.6:
• Code optimizations applied; old unused code removed;
• Added russian language and localization support for user interface;
• Settings are now reset to previously saved when you click 'Cancel' button;
• Logo, 'about' info and quick user manual added to the 'first start' event

Version 1.7:
• Math optimizations applied;
• Logo placement algorithm optimized for 16:9 window mode;
• Added support for file streaming (test mode; not available for users for now);
• Generic code review performed

Version 1.7.2:
• Added OS language autodetection at first launch;
• Added '7MissedCalls' and 'Sail' palettes;
• Generic optimizations for file streaming support applied (test mode; still not
  available for users);

Version 1.8:
• Added ability to set visualization position and size using mouse;
• Fixed invalid behavior of parameters window in case of changing values without
  saving them;

  hardware microphone;
• Some fixes applied to existent palettes

Version 1.8.1:
• Added 'Mirror' palette

Version 1.9:
• Added cumulative effect: in case of intensive and dense beats (or other 
  frequencies that are under detector) visualization background will change its
  color according to selected palette

Version 1.9.1:
• Some fixes applied to existent palettes

Version 1.10:
• Added the ability to set diameter of logo (as a percentage of window's height);
• Some interface improvements applied

Version 1.11:
• Added rotation ability for butterfly histogram;
• More correct palettes usage applied to butterfly histogram

Version 1.12:
• Histogram rotation angle is more precise now;
• 'Beats detector'-based histogram rotation's angle impulse now may be adjusted;

Version 1.13:
• Beat detector's code optimizations applied;
• Some minor bugs fixed;
• Quick logo reset algorithm on settings' changes applied
