### General information

***ConcurrentDraw*** is the sound and music visualization tool. The app allows
you to visualize audio data that comes from system’s output (system mixer
or speakers). All sound that you can play on your PC can be drawn. No additional
codecs are required.

***Warning***: if you encounter a message about the absence of the `BASS.dll` library
in the app assembly, download its latest version from [this link](https://www.un4seen.com/files/bass24.zip).
The library will need to be extracted from the archive.
